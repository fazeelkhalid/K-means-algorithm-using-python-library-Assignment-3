# K-means algorithm using python library Assignment 3
 	K-means clustering In this this exercise, you will implement the K-means algorithm. You will experiment with an example 2D dataset that will help you gain an intuition of how the K-means algorithm works. The K-means algorithm is a method to automatically cluster similar data examples together. Concretely, you are given a training set 〖{x〗^((1)),…,x^((m) )} (where x^((i))∈R^n), and want to group the data into a few cohesive “clusters”.   DataSet. Given Data in the csv file: k-means.csv There are 2 columns (X1,X2). Use pd.read_csv for loading data and substitute “,” with “.”  Implementation of K-means algorithm (80%).   	load and visualize initial data. 	Solve same problem by K-means algorithm using python library  	Test following pairs and define their cluster:  (0.3; 5.2), (2; 4.4), (1.1; 5.2), (5.2; 2.9), (5.3; 3.3), (6.1; 2.8) 	Visualize clusters.  	calculate silhouette_score
